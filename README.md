# Overview
Below is a link to my resume website. All the pages of the website are divided into header, navigation bar, body and footer. To make the website consistent, all the web pages have the same header, navigation bar and footer. The header has my pic, my name, two skills and a link to my social media account. The **home page** provides an overview with video and text. The **education** page has my qualifications. The **Hire Me** Page has my project to showcase my skills which further has three pages: experience/ project and writing page. The **experience** page has my employment history. Lastly. **contact me** page had a form using which users can send me messages (however I have not set up the connectivity of the website with my mail).

# Tech stack used to build the website
 I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the website( 66% is HTML and 34% is CSS). I have used JavaScript just to show messages for the 
 submit form button(contact me page).
